Soft. Syst. Reliability and Performance - project (VSS-E)

# Overview
An analytical performance or reliability model of the supermarket customer flow system utilizing the mathematical analysis.
Based on implementation of a simulation model of the same system, with larger variability (for example to allow different probabilistic distributions of the events)
And comparation of the solutions and discussed results and differences.
